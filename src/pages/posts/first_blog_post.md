Welcome to the new updated __joshrandall.net__. I took the liberty of converting practically the entire site to use the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework, and holy shit it was a journey. I also took the liberty and upgraded CSS, buy converting it all to SCSS. Because the site is now running with Astro, we can convert markdown files to use HTML/Astro files as a layout. I can just type markdown, and have that markdown be turned into HTML on the fly.

That being said, I highly reccomend this framework (use: npm install astro@latest).

On another note, I will be posting to the site more often and working to make sure it looks and performs the best. I have been spending more time on Mastodon (please follow me [here](https://hachyderm.io/@pursuit)). Thank you for taking your time to read this test post!
