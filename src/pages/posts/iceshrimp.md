If you don't like using Twitter, move to the Fediverse.

This is a project I've started about 1-2 months ago, but I haven't had time to write a proper post due to school and work ramping up. 

[Iceshrimp](https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp) is a decentralized social media platform that is built on the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol. It is forked from [Misskey](https://misskey.io/), and is a project that I have been working on to host my own instance of.

It is able to federate with other instances of Misskey, Mastodon, Pleroma, and any other ActivityPub based platforms. It's relatively easy to use, and is a great way to get started with the Fediverse if you are new.

The only thing I can complain about when it comes to the Fediverse is moderation in certain circumstances, but otherwise it's a great place to be. I have been using it for a while now, and I have been enjoying it. I have also been able to meet a few new people on the platform, and I hope the Fediverse continues to grow.

I apologize for the lack of content, more to come soon! üëèüèº
