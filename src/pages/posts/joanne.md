Joanne Randall was my grandmother, who I was lucky to know for my entire life. She was a generous person, who put others before herself every single time. She was a loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She was a friend to many, and she will be missed dearly.

She was an <u>extremely</u> hard working person, and did not stop despite reaching old age. She switched career paths to massage therapy when she turned 50, and never retired until she was forced to due to her short battle with cancer.
