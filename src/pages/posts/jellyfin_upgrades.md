The JRH Jellyfin instance has received a number of upgrades going into 2024. The updates include:
- GTX 1060 now being use for hardware transcoding. HVEC transcoding is now supported.
- Main OS is now moved to an SSD for faster boot times, loading, and stability.
- New 2TB HDD for media storage. Feel free to use [Jellyseerr](https://jellyseerr.joshrandall.net) to request media.
