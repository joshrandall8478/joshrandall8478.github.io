> UPDATE 4/27/24: Meloetta is currently being hosted on cloud, and will remain up during the duration of the downtime

Many JRH services will go down as I physically move servers back home from college. This type of move / downtime happens twice every year, and is usually brief. Here is our current movement plan and what services will be affected:

## Services Affected

### JRH Jellyfin Node
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.joshrandall.net) will go down on April 26th, 2024, and will be back up on April 27th or April 28th. 
The following services will be affected by this downtime:
- [JRH Iceshrimp](https://social.joshrandall.net)
- [Jellyseerr](https://jellyseerr.joshrandall.net)
- [Project Meloetta](https://joshrandall.net/projects/meloetta)
- Peppermint (temporary ticketing service)

---

### JRH Nextcloud Node
[Nextcloud](https://cloud.joshrandall.net) will go down on April 26th, 2024, and will be back up on April 27th or April 28th.
The following services will be affected by this downtime:
- [JRH Gitlab](https://gitlab.joshrandall.net)

---

### JRH Vaultwarden Node
[Vaultwarden](https://bitwarden.joshrandall.net) will be moved to a cloud server temporarily to prevent downtime. A brief maintenance period is planned for April 25th, 2024. Because of the general importance of Vaultwarden due to it being a password manager, there is a chance we move it to cloud permanently if it does not affect performance and security.

The node will go down on April 26th, 2024, and will be back up on April 27th or April 28th. The following services will be affected by this downtime:
- [FreshRSS](https://rss.joshrandall.net)
- [n8n](https://n8n.joshrandall.net)

All other services not listed here will not be affected by this downtime. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me on the [JRH Discord](https://discord.gg/SvPDTBUgpm) or in [my contact section](/#contact).

We are glad that you are enjoying JRH services. Thank you for your patience, support, and understanding!
