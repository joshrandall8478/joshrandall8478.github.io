<h3 style="color:#ff7051;">This serves as an announcement for those who were offered, and used the semi-private VPN service at <span style="color:aqua;">vpn.joshrandall.net</span>. If you were not offered this service, this announcement does not apply to you.</h3>

As of <span style="color:aqua;">7/17/23</span>, the VPN service will be discontinued. This is due to the fact that I am no longer able to maintain the service, and it is not worth the cost to keep it running. I apologize for any minor inconvenience this may cause to anyone who may have been actively using the service.

I am trying to give Proton Mail a try, which also has a VPN service included. Because of this decision to pull support for the main VPN service, I am getting more functionality out of my current arrangement at the same price. I will be using the Proton Mail VPN service for a month, and if it proves to be a worthy replacement, I will continue to use it. If it does not, I will be discontinuing the VPN service entirely, and will not be looking for a replacement.

As for easy local communication (for development), I will create a local wireguard instance soon for this purpose. It will also not be on 24/7, with the soul purpose of development.

For those who desperately need a VPN, previously liked the past arrangement, and are willing to help with server costs (albeit they aren't that much), please get in contact with me at <span style="color: $color_3;">josh@joshrandall.net</span>. I will be more than happy to work something out with you.


In any case, thank you for taking your time to read this üëèüèº
