<h3 style="color:#ff7051;">This serves as an announcement for those who were offered, and used the semi-private VPN service at <span style="color:aqua;">vpn.joshrandall.net</span>. If you were not offered this service, this announcement does not apply to you.</h3>

As of <span style="color:aqua;">7/17/23</span>, the VPN service will be discontinued. This is due to the fact that I am no longer able to maintain the service, and it is not worth the cost to keep it running. I apologize for any minor inconvenience this may cause to anyone who may have been actively using the service.

I am trying to give Proton Mail a try, which also has a VPN service included. Because of this decision to pull support for the main VPN service, I am getting more functionality out of my current arrangement at the same price. For those who desperately need a VPN, I can still let you use any of my <span style="color: #ff897b;">Wireguard</span> profiles through Proton VPN if you were on my previous arrangement, and within my legal and financial limitations (also through no charge to you).

If Proton mail proves to be a worthy replacment of GMail and iCloud mail, then my new arrangement will take place. If it fails, I will recontinue the VPN server and remigrate my domain email back to iCloud. Currently working on RSS feeds for the blog, and a few other things. I will be posting more updates as I go along.

As for easy local communication (for development), I will create a local wireguard instance soon for this purpose. It will also not be on 24/7, with the soul purpose of development.

Thank you for taking your time to read this üëèüèº
