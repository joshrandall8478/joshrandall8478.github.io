This brief article aims to show you how to import Anki flashcards. I use this as an alternative to Quizlet to avoid advertisements and premium paywalls, and due to the fact that Anki is available on almost every platform.

If you have not downloaded Anki before, you can download the application for your desktop/laptop [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> UPDATE 10/19/24: For Linux: Anki has been updated to work with Plasma 6 in some distro repositories. If you are using a distro that has not updated Anki to QT6, you can download the latest version from the Anki website.

Anki is desktop first. Mobile applications act as a companion for the desktop app. For mobile, it is best to create an account and use the [AnkiWeb client](https://ankiweb.net/about). You can then link your account to the Anki desktop application, so that your imported decks will reflect the web application. Otherwise, you can use the mobile app. There is a paid iOS version and an independent Android version.

## Importing a deck
Once you open Anki, you can simply import a deck (an `.apkg` file) by either dragging and dropping, or using the global menu options (File -> Import)

## Resetting deck due dates

Anki uses an intelligent "due date" system for studying flashcards. Meaning when you import the flashcards, it could appear that the pack is empty. All we have to do is set the due date to today. CLick on the desired deck, click browse, select all the cards that appear, and right click "Set Due Date". Then, we set the due date to "0", meaning today.

## Accessing AnkiWeb from any device
First, go to [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/) and create an account. Once that is done, make sure to link your account in your Ank desktop application:

Next, login to [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/). Your flashcard packs should be synced.

Now you can study on any device from the website, including mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.
