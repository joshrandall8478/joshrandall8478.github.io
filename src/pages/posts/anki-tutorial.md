This brief article aims to show you how to import Anki flashcards. I use this as an alternative to Quizlet to avoid advertisements and premium paywalls, and due to the fact that Anki is available on almost every platform.

If you have not downloaded Anki before, you can download the application for your desktop/laptop [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

For mobile, it is best to create an account and use the [AnkiWeb client](https://ankiweb.net/about). You can then link your account to the Anki desktop application, so that your imported decks will reflect the web application. Otherwise, you can use the mobile app. There is a paid iOS version and an independent Android version.

## Importing a deck
Once you open Anki, you can simply import a deck (an `.apkg` file) by either dragging and dropping, or using the global menu options (File -> Import)

## Resetting deck due dates

Anki uses an intelligent "due date" system for studying flashcards. Meaning when you import the flashcards, it could appear that the pack is empty. All we have to do is set the due date to today. CLick on the desired deck, click browse, select all the cards that appear, and right click "Set Due Date". Then, we set the due date to "0", meaning today.
