This site has gotten quite a few compliments when it comes to design, and its simple functionality. Today, we are expanding on some of the design aspects by now extending the background blur styling from the pagination elements to the navbar. The navbar will have the background blur styling on all pages, but it will go fully transparent on the top part of the home page.

The top bar will then become semi translucent when scrolling down on the homepage, and will stay semi translucent on all other pages. Similar effects are in place for the mobile version of the site as well. I will continue to develop the site and improve on its design and functionality for as long as I have the domain name.
