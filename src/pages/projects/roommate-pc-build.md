First physical project I am posting to the site. I've built computers for friends before, but this was the first Micro ATX build I've done. The main difficulties that I encountered were the massive CPU cooler I recommended my friend to get (It's a Noctua cooler, but unfortunately I forgot the exact model), and how close it is to the graphics card + other small physical conflicts due to this being a Micro ATX build.

I was able to get the computer to post after 1-2 hours of building.

The client forgot to order an SSD, so I am testing performance and games on it using my spare [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/) SSD while I wait for their NVMe to come in.
